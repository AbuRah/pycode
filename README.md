Welcome!

This is a simple text editor thus far written in python, utlizing PySide for 
the GUI. I plan on making it a useful, simple text editor/IDE. At the moment, it still is in it's infancy and will require much more work before it becomes a viable text editor worth given any attention to.

I have some basic functionality, namely thus:

- File saving/opening
- basic text editing shortcuts (i.e. cut, paste etc.)
- tabbed interface
- some incomplete syntax highlighting
- common delete/kill operations
- auto-save

A LOT is still missing, so expect bugs...

TO DO:

Just to name of the missing functionality:

- Complete Global shortcuts missing...
- syntax highlighting is broken and missing various programming languages
- needs auto-complete features
- later on I want to incorporate a build engine, e.g. automated code compiling
- terminal access
- line count in margin
- user encoding/decoding specified file opening/saving
- class browser
- theme customization,

This is by no means an exhaustive list, there are more gaps that elude me at the moment. A lot of work still needs to be done but, Inshallah,it will come together over time.

As i continue to implement more functionality I will update accordingly.
