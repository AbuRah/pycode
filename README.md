Welcome!

This is a simple text editor thus far written in python, utlizing PySide for 
the GUI. I plan on making it a useful, simple text editor/IDE. At the moment, it still is in it's infancy and will require much more work before it becomes a viable text editor worth given any attention to.

I have some basic functionality, namely thus:

- File saving/opening
- basic text editing shortcuts (i.e. cut, paste etc.)
- tabbed interface
- lastly, some incomplete syntax highlighting

A LOT is still missing, so expect bugs...

TO DO:

Just to name of the missing functionality:

- lots of shortcuts still missing.
- severly lacking common text edit commands e.g. ctrl+K to clear current line
- syntax highlighting is broken and needs a complete overhaul
- needs auto-complete features
- later on I want to incorporate a build engine, e.g. automatic code compiling

This is by no means an exhaustive list, there are major gaps at the moment. A lot of work still needs to be done but, Inshallah,it will come together over time.

As i continue to implement more functionality I will update accordingly.
