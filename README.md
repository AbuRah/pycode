Welcome!

This is a simple text editor thus far written in python, utlizing PySide for 
the GUI. At the moment, it still is in it's infancy and will require much more work before
it becomes a viable text editor worth given any attention to.

I have some basic functionality, namely thus:

- File saving/opening
- basic text editing shortcuts (i.e. cut, paste etc.)
- tabbed interface
- lastly, some incomplete syntax highlighting

A LOT is still missing.

TO DO:

Just to name of the missing functionality:

- lots of shortcuts still missing.
- severly lacking common text edit commands e.g. ctrl+K to clear current line
- syntax highlighting is broken and needs a complete overhaul

This is by no means an exhaustive list, there are major gaps at the moment. A lot of work still needs to be done but, Inshallah,
will come together over time.

As i continue to implement more functionality I will update accordingly.
