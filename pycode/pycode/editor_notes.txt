Close button on tab does NOT close the tab window.
need to be able to reopen a closed application with the previous work state automatically loaded. i.e. same number of tabs and settings

The ctrl+w will only close the focused tab if it is unique. e.g. if all open tabs are new pages, ctrl+w will start closing them from the far rightmost tab 
NOT the one currently in focus

Need to get rid of the tab highlighting. all shortcuts should work from the main text area WITHOUT infering with the common text edit shortcuts

I think i can modify the x button that appears on the tab by creating a custom widget and setting it with QTabBar.setTabButton()/
I should consider using a custom QTabBar instead of the built-in one. This should give me much more flexbility in designing & coding it.

Make a command that copies the entire document and prompts the user for a new filename. Use the QFile object.
