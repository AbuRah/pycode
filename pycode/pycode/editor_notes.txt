Close button on tab does NOT close the tab window.
need to be able to reopen a closed application with the previous work state automatically loaded. i.e. same number of tabs and settings

The ctrl+w will only close the focused tab if it is unique. e.g. if all open tabs are new pages, ctrl+w will start closing them from the far rightmost tab 
NOT the one currently in focus

Need to get rid of the tab highlighting. all shortcuts should work from the main text area WITHOUT interfering with the common text edit shortcuts

I think i can modify the x button that appears on the tab by creating a custom widget and setting it with QTabBar.setTabButton()/
I should consider using a custom QTabBar instead of the built-in one. This should give me much more flexibility in designing & coding it.

Make a command that copies the entire document and prompts the user for a new filename. Use the QFile object.

!IMPORTANT!: There is a problem with importing Qt from QtCore. Python isn't recognizing it even though i'm attempting to make the import as explicit as possible.
Also, there seems to be an issue with text.indexOf() property; Python isn't recognizing that either. I already searched online for a solution but there isn't any clear problem that relates to what i'm experiencing.
I hypothesize there is an issue with pyside libraries and installation. there could also be an issue with the version that i do have installed currently.
