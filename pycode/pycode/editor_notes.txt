# Need to create a function that will automatically add a tab every time a new document is opened. DONE.

# May need to create a custom TabBar in order to define shortcuts and pull specific functionality out of it. That or 
# override/add new functionality to the QTabWidget class

# Create the ctrl+pgup/pgdn shortcut that moves between tabs

# i may keep the more commonly known shortcuts implicit rather than displayed. e.g edit menu without "cut" option

# Need to look at QSettings, QFileDialog more in depth, and saving, changing states. <=== this is more of Core Functionality

# Add ability to load new instance of editor with last tabpage/file opened

# Eventually need to add the ability to change style and look of the editor

# Break up the main editor file into separate modules pointing towards the main application window constructor

# UNREALTED: Create a brand of soft drink/beverage that is exlusive, yet expensive, with the best ingredients possible. i.e. use an amount of chemicals
that would actually bring about the touted health benefits. The ingredients should NOT be releases except to the buying customer. This is to keep copy cats from 
running with my idea. This is a work in progress. 

# Make an application that can: edit text, browse web, search through e-mail

# create a custom QWidget layout for browsing files on the native filesystem
