# Need to create a function that will automatically add a tab every time a new document is opened. DONE.

# May need to create a custom TabBar in order to define shortcuts and pull specific functionality out of it. That or 
# override/add new functionality to the QTabWidget class

# Create the ctrl+pgup/pgdn shortcut that moves between tabs

# i may keep the more commonly known shortcuts implicit rather than displayed. e.g edit menu without "cut" option

# Need to look at QSettings, QFileDialog more in depth, and saving, changing states. <=== this is more of Core Functionality
