KNOWN BUGS + ISSUES TO ADDRESS:
====================

1- Close button on tab does NOT close the tab window.

2- Syntax highlighter keeps freezing when new code is added. At the moment, Not sure as to why.

3- save state error if pycode is closed with find QDockWidget open

General NOTES:
==============
!IMPORTANT: I believe there is a major lack of foresight regarding my use of root to perform the tests. I know, quite glibly, the root user env may

!- I plan on making the whole editor customizable. I will get to the style and various layout options when the CORE functionality is set and stable.

- I need to be more aware of scope and referencing when it comes to coding in general.

- I think i should develop a separate module for keyboard shortcuts and syntax highlighting classes. I'm also considering doing the same for class methods though
that may not pan out correctly.

- I think i can modify the x button that appears on the tab by creating a custom widget and setting it with QTabBar.setTabButton()/
	I should consider using a custom QTabBar instead of the built-in one. This should give me much more flexibility in designing & coding it.

- Later on i can make the shortcuts customizable using the isEnabled() method of the QShortcut class.

- need to find a way to condense the tab width actions... 

- Ctrl+pgup/pgdn slot/func works, the application is simply not recognizing the pgdn key.


TO-DO LIST:
==========
- reopen last tab ctrl+shift+T

- Rewrite the settings definition to NOT use setgeometry.

- fix ambigious shortcut overload. Most specify focused window to close

- get rid of frame for main textedit area

- use ESC key to close find bar DockWidget

- add options for various layouts

- utilize a layout for the main window

- Make a command that copies the entire document and prompts the user for a new filename. Use the QFile object.

!- need to be able to reopen a closed application with the previous work state automatically loaded. i.e. same number of tabs and settings

- make the tab text a bright color red (or some other color) to indicate the file has been modified yet not saved.

- I will, Inshallah, use QtGui.QCompleter to implement the auto-complete function based upon pre-defined item models. This will automatically look for the commonly
	known blocks of code and finish fill it in for the user.
- fix the pgdn fail to recognize bug


POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS & WORKAROUNDS:
================================

- i believe i can switch between tabs using the .setFocus() func.

UPDATES SINCE LAST GIT COMMIT:
==============================

- added func tab_seek_right to move between tabs with ctrl+pgup; not yet working
- syntax highlighter works for all new tabs.
- add action new window, close window
- set elide right, tab bar still brings up scroll bar if too many tabs are open.
- set focus for shortcuts
- set option for modifying the tab width
- set tab options, 2 spaces, 4, 6, 8

NOTED FIXES:
==============
- for now, QPlainTextEdit is fine.

- I was able to set the focus to the text edit as soon as the app is opened.

- I was able to find a workaround for the .indexOf() method failure. I used the QRegExp.indexIn() method instead which got the syntax highlighter to work.

- I've decided to leave out the Qt.GlobalColor import. I believe i was going about it the wrong way. Instead, I'll use the QColor class to create colors.

- Figured out that Ctrl+W does in fact close the focused tab. I was deceived due to there being no clear difference between the newly opened tabs, and the current tab in focus.

-syntax highlighter works for all newly constructed tabs

- Ctrl+pgup cycles through all tabs now. Error was occuring due to the tab index being zero based. incorrect if statement.

IDEAS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES:
==========================

- At this point, i'm not too sure as to what else i should add, so i will paste so ideas here for consideration
